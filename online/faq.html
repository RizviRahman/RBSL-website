                                    <p>A company’s capital is divided into small equal units of a finite number. Each unit is known as a share. In

                                        shares of any company are known as shareholders.
                                        For example; if the market capitalization of a company is tk.10 lac and a single share is priced at tk. 10
                                        then the number of shares to be issued will be 1 lac.</p>
